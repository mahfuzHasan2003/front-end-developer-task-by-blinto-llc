# Front-End Developer Task by Blinto LLC

This repository contains the solution for the front-end development task assigned by Blinto LLC. The task is to develop a landing page based on the provided Figma design, using only Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The landing page is fully responsive and pixel-perfect according to the design specifications.

## Task Overview

I was provided with a [landing page design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/WitDScgX1YPwq62SVVvAXl/Frontend-Web-Developer--Intern--Assignment?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=Uuf9ABtIbCC8LlIe-0), which includes both desktop and mobile versions. My goal was to implement the design exactly as it is, ensuring the page works seamlessly across all devices.

### Requirements
1. **No CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries**: The task specifies that only Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript should be used. No external frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind are allowed.
2. **Pixel-perfect design**: The landing page must match the Figma design exactly, including spacing, fonts, colors, and layout.
3. **Fully responsive**: The design must look great and be fully functional on both desktop and mobile versions, as per the Figma file.
4. **Clean, maintainable code**: The code should be well-structured, easy to understand, and maintainable for future enhancements.
